# Module 4 |  School District Analysis
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to review standardized test data.  The intent is to analyze the student math and reading scores to get an overview of performance at the school and overall district level.  This is done by calculating the average standardized math and reading scores, as well as the percent passing with a score of over 70 in math, reading, and both math and reading.  In addition, performance on math and reading was assessed by grade per school, spending, school size, and school type.

In particular for this analysis, Thomas High School's scores had to be adjusted due to cheating at the 9th grade level.  A comparison between the original and adjusted results are included as part of this analysis.

-   *How is the district summary affected?*
The district level analysis difference was very small, but still performance was overall lower on passing percents and math scores.  The reading score was not affected.

-   *How is the school summary affected?*
There is no impact on the general school summary, only specifically for Thomas High School, which is addressed below.

-   *How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?*
Similar to the district level, the scores went down by small amounts in all cases except for the reading score, which went up slightly.  However most items were of a difference less than .1%, which the exception of Passing Reading and Passing Overall percents.

-   *How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:*
	-   *Math and reading scores by grade*
Since the grade scores were by school, the noticeable difference is there are no grades for the Thomas High School's 9th grade.
	 -   *Scores by school spending*
There was no change in scores by school spending
	 -   *Scores by school size*
There was no change in scores by school size
	 -   *Scores by school type*
 There was no change in scores by school size
## Summary
Overall changes were minimal between the original analysis and the analysis after adjusting for Thomas High Schools 9th grade scores.  Of the changes that did occur, the two biggest were the fact that there was no average score for math and no average score for reading for Thomas High School's grade 9.   After that, I would take note of Thomas High School's Percent of Students Passing, as this change was greater than .1%.  This in turn also likely had an impact on a fourth item, the Thomas High School Overall Passing Percent, which was also a greater difference than .1% in the new analysis.
